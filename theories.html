            <h2>MJ's Acceptance Letter</h2>
            In Spiderman No Way home, MJ may have said that she did not get into MIT at the beginning of the movie but she simply did not want to hurt the feelings of her friends, Peter Parker, and Ned Leeds. Especially if she wasn't going to go if they didn't get in.

            <h2>Shang-Chi's Rings</h2>
            The rings, in Shang-chi and the Lengend of the Ten Rings, obviously are important objects to the story and the movie but also play a bigger part in the Marvel Universe as a whole. The are ten rings that are supposedly not from aliens or from the magic of sorcers and are extremly old. This suggests that the orin of therings are likely from the eternals since there are ten eternals that protect Earth and they are the only entities or source that meet the other factors of the rings.

            <h2>Heimdal in Thor's Nightmare</h2>
            In Age of Ultron, Wanda controls Thor's mind to show him what he fears most in attempt to break the Avegers. During thor's resulting vision Heimdal is talking about how Thor is going to let down Asgard. Heimdal suddenly says "wake up" in the middle of the rest of his degredation of Thor leaderhip abilities but this does not match the topic and tone of the conversation. Since Heimdal is able to see all and show others what he is seeing so it can be assumed that he would be able to enter Thors vision, even if only for a second, to try and break Thor out of the nightmare.
